BLDC Motor Speed Control
Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation for controlling the speed of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor using a joystick and a Servo motor. The joystick input is read from an analog pin, and its value is used to adjust the speed of the motor by varying the servo angle. This project is ideal for understanding the basics of motor control and joystick interfacing with an Arduino.

Components
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Joystick Module
Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)
Brushless DC Motor (BLDC)
Servo Motor (used to simulate ESC control)
Circuit Diagram
Joystick Module:

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
VRx (Analog output) to A0 on Arduino

ESC:
Signal pin to Digital Pin 9 on Arduino
Power and GND connections as per ESC requirements
Code
The provided Arduino code reads the joystick value and maps it to control the servo motor, which in turn simulates the ESC control for the BLDC motor.


How It Works
Joystick Input: The joystick's analog output is read by the Arduino from pin A0.
Mapping: The analog value (0-1023) is mapped to an angle range (0-180) suitable for the servo motor.
Control: The mapped value is sent to the servo motor, adjusting its position and simulating the ESC control signal for the BLDC motor.
Serial Output: The joystick value and corresponding servo angle are printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging.


Setup Instructions
Connect the joystick module and ESC to the Arduino as described in the Circuit Diagram section.
Upload the provided code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor to view joystick values and corresponding servo angles.
Use the joystick to control the speed of the BLDC motor (through the ESC).


Troubleshooting
Servo Not Responding: Ensure that the ESC is properly connected and calibrated.
Joystick Values Not Changing: Check the joystick connections and verify that the analog pin is functioning correctly.
Serial Monitor Issues: Make sure the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the Serial.begin(9600) setting.
